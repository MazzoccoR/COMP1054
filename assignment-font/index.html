                    <p class="time">A long, long time ago<br>
                    I can still remember how that music</p>
                    <p class="happy">Used to make me smile<br>
                    And I knew if I had my chance<br>
                    That I could make those people dance<br>
                    And maybe they'd be happy for a while</p>
                    <p class="sad">But February made me shiver<br>
                    With every paper I'd deliver<br>
                    Bad news on the doorstep<br>
                    I couldn't take one more step</p>
                    <p class="memoryGone">I can't remember if I cried<br>
                    When I read about his widowed bride<br>
                    But something touched me deep inside</p>

                    Drove my <i>Chevy</i> to the levee, but the levee was <i>dry</i><br>
                    And them good ol' boys were drinkin' <i>whiskey</i> and <i>rye</i><br>

                    If the <i>Bible</i> tells you so?</p>
                    <p class="happy"><i>Now, do you believe in rock 'n' roll</i><br>
                    Can music save your mortal soul<br>
                    And can you teach me how to <i>dance</i> real slow?</p>

                    'Cause I saw you <i>dancin'</i> in the gym<br>
                    You both kicked off your shoes<br>
                    Man, I dig those <i>rhythm</i> and <i>blues</i><br>
                    I was a lonely <i>teenage</i> broncin' buck<br>
                    With a pink carnation and a pickup <i>truck</i><br>
                    But I knew I was out of <i>luck</i></p>

                    The quartet practiced in the <i>park</i><br>
                    And we sang dirges in the dark</p>
